-  git init
- git add . (adds all files in current dir)
- git rm --cached api (remove the file you added for commit)
- git commit -m "client" (adds commit descriptions)
-  git remote -v (show the current connection to the remote repository)
- git remote add origin https://github.com/rasheedfisal/MostaqlClient.git (connect to the repository you want to source control *must be authenticated first*)
- git remote remove https://github.com/rasheedfisal/MostaqlAPI.git (disconnect from current repository connection)
-  git push -u origin main (push the commit to source control *github* in the branch {main})
- git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories (pull the github repo from the bransh {main} with {--allow-unrelated-histories} option to be used in a rare event that merges histories of two projects that started their lives independently).

-------------------------------
-push source to 2 different origins :
1- Create a new repo at github.
2- Clone the repo from fedorahosted to your local machine.
3- git remote rename origin upstream
4- git remote add origin URL_TO_GITHUB_REPO
5- git push origin master

Now you can work with it just like any other github repo. To pull in patches from upstream, simply run {git pull upstream master && git push origin master}.
